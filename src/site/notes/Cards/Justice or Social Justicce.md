I’ve been working on reconciling the ideas of Justice and Social Justice, and how these terms are used in todays world. A lot of times people use the terms interchangeably, but they really are two different ideas, based on two very different premises. And when we get the two confused we can find ourselves supporting ideas we may not completely agree with.

Social Justice in the Bible

You’ve probably already noticed this, but people like to go to the Bible and pull verses to support their favored position. When I did a search looking for articles that gave examples of social justice in the Bible I was rewarded with a lot of different articles to sift through. The problem was, most of what I got were really examples of justice.

Micah 6:8 is one of the popular ones. It says “He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.”

Great verse, but it points to justice, not social justice. At least, not the way we use the term today.

To start out I think we need to define our terms. For that, let’s turn to our old friend Dictionary.com. I figured that would give me a starting point that I think the majority of us could accept.

**Justice**: The administering of deserved punishment or reward.

**Social Justice**: Fair treatment of all people in a society, including respect for the rights of minorities and _equitable distribution_ of resources among members of a community.

#### Individual vs. Group Justice

Part of my problem is one form looks at justice for the individual, while the other looks at justice for a group. As a guy that really would like to see more unity I have a problem with the ongoing effort to divide us into different [[Cards/teams\|teams]]. Whether it’s by race, or gender, or social class the division is ongoing. It’s the oppressors vs the oppressed. The “haves” vs the “have-nots.” 

Look, I understand the past oppressions that have occurred and how they affect the current population. I’ve written about it before. But you cannot commit an injustice against one person or group in order to “correct” a past injustice to another person or group. That’s not justice, especially if the person you are wronging was not involved in the original injustice.

#### Is it Justice?

Here’s an example of what I’m talking about. Let’s say Bob Baker and Sally Smith are both applying for a job opening. Although Sally Smith is clearly more qualified for the position she is passed over for Bob simply because he is a man. Obviously, this is an injustice to Sally. After a little time passed, because Bob was not qualified for the job he was let go and the job was open again. Sally reapplied, but so did John Johnson, who happened to be the **most** qualified to for the job. In order to “fix” the injustice that was done to Sally in the first hiring, she was given the job. Was this justice? In trying to make a past injustice right, they have now done an injustice to John, who was not at all involved in the initial injustice, but was passed over for a lesser qualified candidate.

#### Redistribution

My second problem with the idea of social justice is the “equitable distribution of resources.” 
Who gets to decide what is equitable? And who decides who the money is taken from? And who gets to decide who the taken money is given to? 
My experience has been that the ones who want to make those decisions are typically **not** the people I want making those decisions. It takes a certain amount of hubris to think you are smart enough to reshape the distribution of wealth in our country.

It seems to me that the difference between justice and social justice line up with the differences between equality and equity. _(Hint for what’s to come: I prefer equality.)_
