With so many problems that are bubbling up, what is the one thing I need to start with that will have the most impact? I can't fix everything at the same time, and it would be fruitless to try. Taking on too many priorities at once will only derail the effort.

With any list of tasks or problems, there will be varying levels of importance and urgency. I need make sure to focus on important tasks, and get them handled before they become urgent.
