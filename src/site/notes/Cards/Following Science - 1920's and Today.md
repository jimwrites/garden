## Following Science - 1920's and Today

I've noticed a parallel as I read Thomas Sowell's [[Sources/Highlights/Intellectuals and Race - HL\|Intellectuals and Race - HL]] (Ch 3 especially). He discusses people in the early 20th Century that used "science" to make the case for the differences in the races; more specifically that one race was superior to others.

I use the word "science" loosely. So much of what was put forward was carefully curated circumstantial evidence that used info that supported a certain position, while disregarding everything that went against that narrative.

We look back on previous generations, and we see the glaring flaws in their logic, and we look at them with contempt. Their views were racist, and no sane person could actually believe what they were saying was true.

Now, flash forward to modern times. I see us doing the same thing with several social issues, and I think future generations will look upon us with scorn, and will not be able to understand how we could be so backward in our thinking.
