## Following Science - 1920's and Today

I've noticed a parallel as I read Thomas Sowell's [[Sources/Highlights/Intellectuals and Race - HL\|Intellectuals and Race - HL]] (Ch 3 especially). He discusses people in the early 20th Century that used "science" to make the case for the differences in the races; more specifically that one race was superior to others.

I use the word "science" loosely. So much of what was put forward was carefully curated circumstantial evidence that used info that supported a certain position, while disregarding everything that went against that narrative.

We look back on previous generations, and we see the glaring flaws in their logic, and we look at them with contempt. We see them as being backwards in their thinking. And we see  how they were attempting to use "the science" to support their pre-existing ideas. 

We think that their views were racist, and no sane person could actually believe what they were saying was true.

Hypothesizing is not science. Trusting the experts is not science. thinking that it might make sense is not science.

Flash forward to modern times and you can see people engaged in the same behavior as out backwards thinking forefathers. On any number of issues we can see people "following the science" without any scientific evidence to support the claims.

Look at how something as recent as COVID was handled. So much mis-information was put forth as being backed by science. Then, when opinions were reversed, the reversal was also backed by the science.

For instance, when the pandemic was first declared Dr. Fauci stated that masking for the general public was not necessary. He then reversed that position, beginning the mask mandates. These mandates continued, even after the actual science stated that because of the airborne nature of the virus, only properly fitter N95 masks were at all effective.

And that's just scratching the surface. There are several social issues that fall into the category of "science with no evidence".

I wonder if future generations will look upon us with scorn, and will not be able to understand how we could be so backward in our thinking.
