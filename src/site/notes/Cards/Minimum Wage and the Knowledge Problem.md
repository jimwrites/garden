In my [previous post](http://www.jimsmoot.com/thinking-about-the-minimum-wage/) I wrote about my feelings that the government should not be over-stepping their responsibilities by mandating a minimum wage. Honestly, I think that economists have made a pretty convincing argument that we should do away with all minimum wages, and allow the market to dictate prices, but I also understand that is never going to happen. 

Those in power don’t have a good track record of giving power back once they’ve gotten it, and the people that don't understand the economics of it have very loud voices.

I said that one big concern is the [Knowledge Problem.](https://fee.org/articles/hayek-the-knowledge-problem/) In a nutshell, the knowledge problem is that each one of us has knowledge about our own lives and interactions. It is impossible for any centralized group, like Congress, to be able to understand and consider all of the knowledge that pertains to any situation. So, for minimum wage legislation, the government cannot adequately consider all of the [unseen](http://www.jimsmoot.com/the-seen-and-the-unseen/) consequences of their rules. They do not see that the the people they are claiming to try to help will get hurt the most through lost jobs and lost opportunities.

#### Lost Jobs

There are several things that play into how much a company pays an employee. One is the going market rate for labor, and another is how much economic value the employee brings to the company. _This isn’t a discussion about worker dignity. This is an economic discussion looking at labor as a commodity._

If the company decides that you cost more than the value you bring to the company, your employment will be ended.

Have you ever thought about why so many cashier positions at your local grocery have been replaced with self-checkout? The stores didn’t do that simply for your convenience. They did it because they can keep customers moving through the payment system without having to pay a person to stand behind a register all day. During slow times when there are few customers, the self-checkout doesn’t cost the company an hourly wage.

If the current “Fight for 15” movement gets it’s way, and the minimum wage gets raised to $15 an hour, you can expect to see more fast food and quick serve restaurants following suit and moving toward self-order kiosks, and away from paid employees.

#### Higher Prices

For businesses that don’t lay off employees, you can expect to see an increase in the cost of goods and services.

I had someone argue with me once that McDonald's would be able to absorb the cost of an increase in the minimum wage to $15, and a Big Mac would still cost the same as it does now. This defies basic laws of economics.

When I got my degree in restaurant management, we were taught to figure the restaurants budget with one-third of the operating cost going for labor. Where I live the minimum wage is current $8.80 per hour. An increase to $15 would be an immediate increase in labor cost of just over 41%.

I have to add here that most restaurants run on a tight budget. Celebrity chefs and franchises aside, there isn't a ton of profit for a restaurant owner/operator. Owners cannot simply eat the increases in cost over the long run.

As a restaurant operator I only have a few options. I can reduce the number of people on staff, which would reduce the level of service I can provide. I can reduce the amount I spend on supplies, which would result in a lower quality of meal that I serve my customers. Or, I can raise the amount I have to charge my customers for their meal.

And it’s not just my costs that are increasing. All along the supply chain suppliers are faced with making the same decisions. An increase in the cost of my supplies would also create more strain on the budget, and affect my financial decisions.

#### Lost Opportunities

In order to move up within an organization, you first need to get the experience necessary for the higher paying positions. If there is a reduction in the number of available entry-level position, there is no way to get the experience you need.

Going back to the restaurant example, it makes sense that cooks in high-end restaurants earn more that a cook at McDonald’s. But most high-end restaurants aren’t taking people with no experience and making them cooks. they want to hire people that have already learned their lessons, and can handle the volume and quality that customers expect when they are dropping $50-plus per meal.

The same is true with servers. You have to develop your skills at fast food, quick service, or small restaurants, then work your way up. Even places like Applebee’s are looking for people with prior experience.

Employers can be more selective in who they hire. If those entry-level opportunities are no longer available, people are going to have a harder time getting through the door, and moving into higher paid skilled and management positions.

So who gets hurt the most in all of this? Typically it is the people at the lower end of the economic scale. It’s not the people graduating with a degree from a University, although those people are finding it increasingly difficult to get their foot in the door. But those that do find work are typically moving into positions that are already above minimum wage. Even tech schools are moving their grads into skilled positions. But for the under-educated, for the GED and drop-out crowd, those entry level jobs are going to be a lot harder to find. And if you have any kind of a criminal record, good luck finding anything.

And the cycle of poverty continues.
