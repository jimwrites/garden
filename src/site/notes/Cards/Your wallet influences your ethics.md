### Premise

We're very opinionated when it comes to the economics of social issues. And some of it sounds really good. I mean, who is really against people earning a living wage for their labor. There are far too many people in this country that work 40-hour weeks, and still can't afford the basics. People shouldn't have to choose between paying rent, having heat, or eating.

We also have issues like  keeping jobs here at home instead of shipping them overseas where labor safety is lax, and child labor is rampant.

But far too often we don't put our money where our mouth is. We make excuses for our behavior, and complain that other's aren't doing their part to break the cycle.
### Point 1
Look at the Walmart parking lot on any given Saturday. It's packed. People regularly flood that store. Why?

Because prices are low, and we're all trying to get as much bang for our buck as possible.

And how do stores like Walmart manage to keep their prices so low? It's largely because they source merchandise from low cost sources, with goods that are mostly made overseas. Then they staff those stores with low wage employees, many of whom don't work enough hours per week to qualify for benefits.

And what about those tipped employees. Reddit threads regularly berate restaurants that make servers rely on tips to make a living. But how often do you go to a restaurant that doesn't allow tipping. I've seen a few try over the years, but it never seems to last.

People see higher menu prices, and they stop frequenting the restaurant because the prices are too high. It doesn't matter that the total cost of the bill is the same. It seems higher.

Turns out we're not always the most rational creatures.
### Why it matters
We tend to be very self-serving. We really mean what we say about helping others. We really do believe that people should be able to earn more. We want people to have better benefits.

But when it comes to digging into our own wallets to make that change happen...

Because moneys tight, and seems to be getting tighter. It's hard to justify spending more to support the local farm or the locally owned business when I know I can stretch that dollar farther at the big discount store.
