I got into a brief Twitter discussion a while back about tipping. The conversation started with whether or not restaurants should be forced to pay servers a “living wage” and end the practice of tipping. The encounter was just a few friendly tweets back and forth, but it got me thinking (like it always does), about the bigger issue of artificially setting economic floors and ceilings on business and people.

First, as a former food service worker, I can tell you that a lot of servers would not want to be doing that job without tips. In busy mid-range or higher end restaurants tips far exceed what servers would earn on an hourly wage. It would also remove some of the incentives for servers to work as hard as they do. If I wasn’t earning tips, why should I be overly concerned if your coffee cup was sitting empty. As long as I can get me side-work done, do enough to keep the boss off my back, and clock out on time…it’s all good.

But the bigger issue for me is the argument that the government should step in and mandate what any company should pay their workers, as if with a stroke of the pen they can dictate how much value an employee brings to a company.

My comment on Twitter is that if restaurants were forced to pay servers enough to eliminate the need to tipping it would drive the menu prices up, and people would complain. _(Never mind the fact that the meal may cost the same in the end. Increased menu prices make it seem higher, and we’re not always very good at thinking these things through.)_ People will choose to go where the perceive they are getting the best value.

It's another example of [[Cards/The Seen and The Unseen\|The Seen and The Unseen]]. We see servers getting a bigger paycheck. The 'unseen' is a lower level of service, or worse, serves getting laid off because customers are unwilling to pay the higher cost of their meals.

It’s similar to the complaints people have over how much Walmart pays their employees. It’s been shown that a lot of Walmart employees receive government assistance. Some people will readily tell you how unfair that is, and how “evil” Walmart is, but have you looked at their parking lot on any given Saturday? The ones I see are always pretty full. Despite the complaints, **people will shop where prices are lower**.

I was told that it’s unethical not to pay a reasonable wage. My response was if that were true, *it would be equally unethical to support a business that that behaved that way*. It seems we like to make all of these problems someone else’s responsibility.

So again, the issue is whether it is the government's responsibility to determine a living wage, or whether it is better for the free market to do what it does best, and to adjust to meet the needs of supply and demand.

_( --Sarcasm Alert-- And as an aside, if the state can randomly decide businesses have to pay workers more, why can’t the state also legislate a reduction in the cost of living? After all, Walmart’s wages would be sufficient if prices would come down. )_

But the real problem is a knowledge problem. **No one person or committee has anywhere close to enough knowledge to be able to know all of the fallout created from artificially manipulating wages.**

[I have a lot more to say on this](http://www.jimsmoot.com/minimum-wage-and-the-knowledge-problem/), but I think that's enough to at least start the discussion.
