## LGBTQIA+ vs Survival of the Fittest

If we buy the notion of evolution over the idea of intelligent design, we must also accept the idea of survival of the fittest. In order for a species to survive it needs to reproduce. Natural selection would, over time, eliminate any characteristics or traits that would impede the proliferation of a species.

If that is true, what does that do to the "born this way" argument of the LGBTQIA+ community? They argue that gender is merely a social construct, and that it is completely natural for them to be the way they are.

Given the evolutionary nature of human development, which is more likely, that LGBTQIA+ is natural, or that this is a conscious/sub-conscious reaction to something else (trauma?) that has occurred in their life?

There is a section in [[Sources/Books/Seeking Wisdom\|Seeking Wisdom]] that talks about life events, and that [[Cards/What happens to us isn't as important as what we think happens\|What happens to us isn't as important as what we think happens]]. It is what we do with those events, and how we react to them that form the mental patterns that effect or future development and reaction to events that occur for the rest of our lives
