A cognitive bias where people under estimate their own ability in any given area. This is because our lack of self awareness keeps us from seeing our shortcomings.

We all have blindspots. It is easy to see the shortcomings and flaws of others, but it is much more difficult to notice our own.

A fish doesn't notice the water it swims in.
