There seems to be a growing misunderstanding of labor provided to a business, and the people within the business. It shows up in forums where people are complaining about all of the things their employer is not doing for them, and how they feel no sense of loyalty, to the point that some of them are actively sabotaging the business.

One thing that needs to be established is that [[Cards/Labor is a commodity\|labor is a commodity]]. It is something the business needs to operate, and they purchase that on the labor market. It's not about the employee as a person, it's about labor.

My employer had a need, and I had the skills necessary to fill that need. They offered me compensation in exchange for my time and talents. Their obligation to me is to honor their offer by paying me the agreed upon wages and benefits. My obligation to the business is to provide the service that they are paying for.

The other part of the equation is people.

While I may not owe the business anything more than I agreed upon, I do feel a sense of commitment to the people I work with and for. That's the personal part, the relationships that I have built with the people I work for and with.

And while the business may uphold 100% of their obligation, the work environment is a result of the people and the leadership within the organization. It is the [[Cards/People create the work environment\|people that can make the work environment welcoming or toxic]]
