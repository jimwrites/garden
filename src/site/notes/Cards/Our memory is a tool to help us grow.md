The purpose of our memory is to look back and see what worked and what didn't. It is a tool to help us learn from our past.

It's purpose is not for us to dwell on the past, reliving our failures and wishing we had done things differently. We get into a cycle of beating ourselves up over things we can no longer change

It's OK to regret past decisions, but the more important thing is, what can you change as you move forward in life? Are you staying the same, making the same mistakes? Or, are you learning (and making different mistakes). [[Inbox/What are you going to do about it\|What are you going to do about it]]?

The past is the past. There is nothing we can do to change any of it.
