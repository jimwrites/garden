There is a thing in criminal justice called the “Broken Window” theory. The thought behind it is that if a broken window in a house is left unfixed it sends a message that no one cares, or that the house is abandoned. Soon other windows in the house will be broken. If the problem is still not addressed broken windows will begin appearing in other houses in the neighborhood. If this is not fixed the message gets sent that the people in the neighborhood either don’t care, or are afraid to report the problem. The result is that crime will soon go up; first petty crime, followed quickly by muggings, assault, and murder.

History has shown that one of the more effective ways of combating the rampant crime in an area is to start by cracking down on misdemeanor crimes, crimes that would in the past be ignored because there were more pressing problems. Before too long after cracking down on petty crimes the bigger crime rates begin to drop significantly.

### The American Christian Church

I was reading about this in Malcolm Gladwell’s book “Tipping Point”, and it got me thinking about how this applies to the American Christian church. In many churches across this country we have lost our connection with Christ, and with that, our desire to live the way He wants us to live. We are more focused on living the way we want to live, and then trying to use scripture to justify our life choices.

I don’t want this to sound like a call for legalism, or as an excuse to condemn other, but more as a call to examine our own lives daily, and to really ask ourselves if we are living a life that Christ would approve of.

### Take the plank from your own eye

We have gotten very good at overlooking our petty sins. We do things, and behave in ways that are clearly not Biblical. We gossip, we act out of anger, we display greed, jealousy, and gluttony. And we make excuses for all of it.

The bad part is, as we make those excuses we send the message to ourselves and those around us that this behavior is OK, and so there isn’t any reason to stop. And if I can act however I want and still call myself a Christian, then there really isn’t anything someone else does that can’t also be justified.

And in an effort to appear loving and accepting (you know, love the sinner but hate the sin) we have also given up our heart for pointing out sin, even when the Bible does so. We soften the hard parts of scripture, and [[Making God in our image\|we try to mold God]] into a being that will accept us, warts and all, without our ever having to make any effort to conform to his will.

### Change starts with me

But changing that starts with individuals. It starts with me. I need to be better at calling out the sin in myself, stop making excuses, and begin to make the needed changes to rid my life of sin wherever I can. I need to start repairing my own broken windows.
