Every thing you do is a building block in the construction of the person you are. Every decision, and every action you have taken in the past has built the person you are today.

While we may look back on the past and lament some of the decisions we made, those decision led to more decisions, which led to still more decisions, that led you to...you. And there is not a thing you can do to change any of that, It's set in stone.

The beauty of it all is, you are in charge of designing, and building, the person you are becoming. If you don't like where your decisions have led you, make different decisions going forward.

### Your memory is a tool for growth

And while we can't change anything in our past, or change our decisions and the resulting outcomes, that doesn't means we shouldn't look back. When it comes to [[Cards/personal growth\|personal growth]], your memory is a great tool. 

Rather than looking back in regret, we should look back to learn what did and didn't work for us, so we can act differently going forward. Our memory wasn't designed so you can beat yourself up about the past. [[Cards/Our memory is a tool to help us grow\|Our memory is a tool to help us grow]].

### You have the tools you need

You have the tools you need to build a better version of you. And even if you like the person you are, that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. We can all make changes, no matter how small, to build a better version of ourselves. 

Small steps forward lead to small steps forward, which lead to a new you.
