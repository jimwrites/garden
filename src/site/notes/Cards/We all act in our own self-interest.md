## We all act in our own self-interest
[[Cards/personal growth\|personal growth]]

I had a philosophy professor that said ultimately everyone always does what they want to do. Given the available choices, we choose what is in our own self-interest. The choice can benefit us physically, or emotionally. 

There are not self-less acts

> Some behavior may under certain conditions look like altruism but can often be explained by self-benefit. Social recognition, prestige, fear of social disapproval, shame, relief from distress, avoidance of guilt, a better after-life or social expectations are some reasons behind "altruistic" acts.
