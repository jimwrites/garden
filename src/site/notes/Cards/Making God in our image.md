We have a tendency to think about God in our own terms. We pick out the parts of God that we like, such as love, grace, and forgiveness, but ignore the parts we don't like. We reject the angry God. We don't like to think about a God the destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and the flooded the Earth because of our sin.

I liken this to the difference of a teddy bear and a grizzly bear. Teddy bears are soft and cuddly, and are designed to look like a representation of a real bear. But a real bear isn't a teddy bear. If you treat a grizzly like you treat a teddy, things will not go well for you.
