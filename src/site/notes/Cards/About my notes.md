I want to get a few ideas about my note-taking, and how I am trying to approach this.

#### My notes are for me
First, my note are for me. If someone else gets something out of this, great. But the main purpose if for me to develop and focus my thinking. Although my plan is to use the notes here to create writing in other areas, what I write here is for me. That means sometimes the thoughts may seem incomplete or vague, but that is part of the process of thinking through things

By posting it here I am making an attempt to [work with the garage door open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zVFGpprS64TzmKGNzGxq9FiCDnAnCPwRU5T). Although my plan is to use the notes here to create writing in other areas, what I write here is for me.

#### Notes start out small
Many of the notes I take start out as seeds that will develop over time. These should be atomic notes, that are focused on one idea. Over time these ideas will link to other notes, and the knowledge base will grow.

#### Notes should be linked
Much of the structure from this site will come from links between notes. This will help me think through how I can make the associations between ideas

#### Initial structure is minimal
Although I have some areas I want to explore, I don't want to create any kind of framework that I have to work inside of. I want this garden to grow organically.

As the garden grows I will create some Maps of Content to help keep it somewhat organized.
