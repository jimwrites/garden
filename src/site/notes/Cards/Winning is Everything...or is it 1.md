For some, winning is everything.

Whether for the team, or for themselves, it's win at all costs. In fact, they become so focused on winning that they've completely lost sight of whether their opinion is right or wrong. They assume they're right, because their team told them they were right.

They may not ever stop to think about whether whatever they're fighting for is even worth fighting for. Every hill is a hill they're willing to die to protect. To cede even one inch is seen as a defeat, so they fight until there is no more competing ideas or opinions.

But to what end?

There will always be differing opinions on whatever subject you want to talk about. No one is ever in 100% agreement with anyone.

So the battle continues ad infinitum.

Sadly, this only serves to anchor people in their current mindset and belief structure. They are not willing , or able to examine their beliefs.

In order to grow, we need to challenge our own beliefs. But that's hard work. It requires self-reflection. It requires being open to the possibility that you might be wrong.

We've gotten so good at building systems that support what we want to believe that we automatically put up defenses against anything that challenges that system. Whether it's who we follow on Twitter, or what news sources we turn to, or what podcast we listen to, we tend to surround ourselves with voices that sound an awful lot like our own.

But if I really want to be better, I need to be willing to admit that even if I disagree with someone, there might be some truth in what they're saying.

This means stepping out of your comfort zone, and considering new, different voices. Voices that exit outside of your current echo chamber. Not that you have to embrace all (or any) of the things that are being said. But, look for things that might ring true. Do your own fact-checking. Turns out, sometimes the voices on social and corporate media get it wrong.

Part of the problem is, we have gotten so lost in our team identity, that we no long know who we are as individuals. We've lost our individual voice, and well, it's just easier to go along

And until we can figure out our true identity as individuals, we will never be able to break free from what the group tells us to believe. We will always be lost in the team identity.
