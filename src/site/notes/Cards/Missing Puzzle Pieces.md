## Missing Puzzle Pieces

Every piece is important. A piece that is not connected does not reflect that importance. Without all of the pieces, the puzzle is incomplete

[[Scripture (WEB)/43 - John/John-15#v4\|John-15#v4]] says we need to be connected to Christ. Through Christ we connect to wone another.

This ties to the idea of [[Cards/identity\|identity]], and the thought that [[we live out our identity in community\|we live out our identity in community]]. No piece of the puzzle functions alone.
