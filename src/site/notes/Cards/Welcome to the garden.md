This is my project to learn in public. Sometimes the thoughts will be incomplete, in fact, sometime they will be down-right messy. This is an attempt to learn in public, to let you see how my thoughts develop, and how they interconnect.

It will be interesting to see what we can grow.

This page is a landing place where I can link to areas that I am interested in. As my knowledge base grows, this page will grow.

There is no "starting here" link. Jump in wherever it looks interesting. The links below are a sort of Map of Content where I will make some attempt to make my notes easier to find. 

The graph to the right is a visual representation of how the notes link together.
