When we disagree with something we tend to attack the validity of the person or thing, rather than take on the argument itself.

When the Supreme Court makes a ruling we don't like, it is because the justices were appointed by a President we don't like, or they have gone rogue.

Very little time is spent addressing if they made the legally correct decision.
