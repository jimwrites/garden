#### White is not a person. Black is not a person.

Those are teams we identify with. Jim is a person. Mike is a person. Julie is a person. When you think of team first you find yourself defending your team. When you think people first you make more efforts toward unity. This is true in race relations, politics, sports, and many other areas of our lives.

#### Terry Bradshaw, Albert Belle, and Roberto Alomar

These three athletes might not seem like they belong in the same group, but I chose them for a reason. They are examples of how ‚Äúteam‚Äù irrationally influences your perception of a person in a way that has absolutely nothing to do with who that person really is.

Terry Bradshaw was the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 70‚Äôs and early 80‚Äôs. Growing up as a Browns fan, I hated Terry Bradshaw when I was a kid (and if I‚Äôm being honest, as a young man). Here‚Äôs the thing, I knew absolutely nothing about Bradshaw as a man. All I knew was that he played for the rival team, and that has team regularly beat my Browns. His team identity was enough to evoke strong negative emotions in me. It turns out that Bradshaw is a decent person. He‚Äôs got a great sense of humor, and I enjoy listening to his commentary on games.

Contrast that with Albert Belle. Belle played for the Cleveland Indians, and was considered one of the more dangerous hitters in the league. He was ill tempered, and was not above cutting corners to gain an advantage on the field. I didn‚Äôt care because he could crush the ball, he played for my team, and he didn‚Äôt have to be a nice guy as long as he was helping us win. He was on my team, so I was all on board with Belle.

Then there‚Äôs Roberto Alomar. I first heard of Alomar when he was playing for the Baltimore Orioles, and you guessed it, I didn‚Äôt like Mr. Alomar. He once spit in an umpire‚Äôs face because he didn‚Äôt like the call, and my opinion was people like that shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed on the field. He should have been suspended for life. Until that glorious day that my Indians signed Alomar to a 4-year deal, and this future Hall of Famer was now our second baseman. Do you think I condemned the Indians for signing him? Absolutely not. Roberto Alomar was one of the best second basemen playing, so now all past sins were forgiven.

A similar scenario gets played out every day on social media. President Trump is regularly condemned for doing things previous presidents were praised for, and praised for doing things his predecessor was attacked for doing. Why? Because one is a Republican and one is a Democrat. Now we‚Äôre preparing for a Joe Biden administration, and Biden will use the same tools and wield the same power that Trump had access to. And we can all predict what‚Äôs going to happen. The Democrats will praise President Biden‚Äôs every move, while the Republicans will gleefully treat him with disrespect and disdain.

This is not a discussion about whether the actions of one or the other is right or wrong. The point is that [[Cards/for some people right and wrong aren‚Äôt overly important\|for some people right and wrong aren‚Äôt overly important]]. What‚Äôs important is not only that my team wins, but your team has to lose!
