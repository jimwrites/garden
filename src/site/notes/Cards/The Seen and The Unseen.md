I think it’s dishonest to try and talk about race in this country without acknowledging the legacy of racism that has haunted our nation. The situation that people of color in the US are in today is, at least in part, the result of mistreatment and unconscionable policies that were in place in years past. I say in part because I don’t think you can totally absolve current government policies or personal behavior for their part in contributing to the current state of affairs.

And while you may not be able to point to specific laws or systems that are themselves racist, that doesn’t mean that the sins of our fathers don’t continue to haunt us. But I believe those sins are largely overshadowed by a system that has created a semi-permanent victim class. It is a living example of what French economist Frederic Bastiat referred to when he wrote about the seen and the unseen.

**The Seen**

When LBJ started his war on poverty he set up a welfare system that would provide government money to Americans who are living below the poverty line. What is seen is that millions of Americans were provided food, housing, medical, and living expenses to help them survive. On the surface that seems like a wonderful thing. People were provided a leg up, and much needed help as they worked to improve their conditions to the point that they no longer needed a government subsidy.

**The Unseen**

The unseen part is how it played out in reality, the part that the decision makers either didn’t see or chose not to see. Despite trillions of dollars being spent, the problem has not gotten any better. Today there is a group of people suffering from generational poverty. The way the welfare program is administered created a system where once you are in it, it becomes difficult to get back out. For those in entry level jobs, the loss of benefits and subsidies are not made up for with the low entry-level wages. Taking these jobs becomes a net loss, so people are passing up on employment for the sake of caring for their families. By passing up entry level jobs they are also passing up future opportunities that would significantly improve their earning potential, and providing a way to rise above the poverty levels they are stuck in.

It has led to other problems as well. Fatherlessness in that welfare funded community has skyrocketed. And that isn’t strictly a racial issue. It’s true in the white and black communities alike. Dropout rates soar. You don’t need to worry about an education if Uncle Sam is taking care of everything. Crime is rampant. And for some, life itself has lost its value.

Like so many things it is an extremely complicated problem. While the welfare program is a huge contributor, I don’t believe you can put this all off on welfare any more than you can push it all off on systemic racism. There are a lot of moving parts that all need to be addressed. And that is going to require time, hard work, and a lot of challenges.
