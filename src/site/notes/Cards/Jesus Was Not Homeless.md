I want to follow up on what I started last week in my [last post](https://www.jimsmoot.com/jesus-was-not-a-socialist/) with the second part of a big pet-peeve of mine.

On a regular basis I see people posting that Jesus was homeless. Sorry, but believing that requires a total disregard for what the Bible actually says.

## Nowhere to lay His head

Every argument I see from people holding this viewpoint is pinned to Matthew 8:20 (or Luke 9:58). “And Jesus said to him, ‘Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’” While I can see how some people can make the leap to Jesus saying he didn't have a home, but when you look at it in context…which you should, that assumption makes absolutely no sense.

In Matthew 8:19 a man approached Jesus saying "I will follow you anywhere." So, for verse 20 to be about homelessness, you're surmising the conversation went something like:

Man: "Jesus, I will follow you anywhere."

Jesus: "Dude, I'm homeless."

Does that seem like a reasonable response to the mans statement?

What I believe it means is that Jesus is letting the man know that there is a cost to following Him. It's not going to be a life of sunshine and lollipops. Biblically, the idea of laying your head down refers to finding peace. Christ is saying to the man, wherever we go, trouble will follow,

Making the claim that Jesus is homeless also requires you to ignore a lot of important details, including other verses that point to Jesus having a house.

There is a lot we don't know about the life of Jesus. The Gospels highlight events during the ministry years, but there is a lot that isn't talked about. What we do know is that Jesus was a carpenter. The Bible indicates that he was a builder. He had a skill that he could use for gainful employment, and would give him the ability to support himself. Jesus, being a devout Jew, would have been aware of the Jewish view on laziness (drop a finger anywhere in Proverbs and you'll find Solomon writing about industriousness). As a 30-year old man in good health, Jesus would not have been looked on favorably if he were merely a beggar.

## Jesus had a home in Capernaum

So if tradition doesn't convince you, let's look at a couple of verses.

_When he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. So many gathered around that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the door; and he was speaking the word to them._ (Mark 2:1-2)

Did you catch that? Mark wrote that Jesus was home. Not staying at Peter’s house. Not sitting by the city gates. He was at home.

_And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him. And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him._ (Mark 2:14-15)

There are many people that think this refers to Levi's house, but again, if you look at it in context that doesn’t appear to be the case. If I saw you on the street and said "Follow me," would it make sense that I would lead you back to your house?

"Surprise! Think I'm gonna hang out here for a while. Oh, by the way, I invited a lot of people over. You got any chips?"

No. Levi went to Jesus’ house. While Jesus was there a lot of other people came by to be with him. Do you think they all would have known where to find him if he was at Levi’s?

Again, No. He was at home.

I know that this post isn't going to change the minds of anyone that already has their mind made up. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote, "One thing is absolutely definite: not everything that enters our ears penetrates our consciousness." But knowing that others don’t listen does not mean I should stop speaking the truth.

And I know that I'll continue to see the same memes making the round, but I just had to get my thoughts down so I have a resource for those that are willing to listen.
