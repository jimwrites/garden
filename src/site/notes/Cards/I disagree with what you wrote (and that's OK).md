Jordon Peterson once said "In order to be able to think, you  have to risk being offensive."

I don't want to get into a discussion on the virtues and vices of Peterson, but sometimes the man made some good points. He's also a good example of what this article is about; in order to have any important discussions, you have to be willing to face disagreement.

Even if I mostly agree with what you are writing, many times there are things within the article that I disagree with, or feel like the point the writer was trying to make wasn't clear. This is especially true of articles that go beyond window-dressing, and dig deeper into a topic.

So my disagreement isn't necessarily a disagreement with the overall premise of the article. Sometimes, it's that I want to clarify a point, or to give you an opportunity to make a more convincing argument.

I feel like I come of as a bit of a contrarian. The articles that make me want to respond are the ones that have points I disagree with. When I agree and enjoy the article I'll give you a few claps, but I don't feel compelled to take the time to write a response. If I do decide to craft a response it's because I want to engage further.

Like you, I don't agree with anyone on everything. I have never met another person that I agree with 100% of the time.  I'm OK with that. I have long said that if two people are exactly the same, one of them isn't necessary. We're all different, with our own unique perspective of the world around us.

I have found, it is in those areas of disagreement that I have had some of my most meaningful conversations. When I explore those areas of disagreement I have had my own beliefs challenged, and I either reinforce my position, or learn things that change my position. It's an opportunity to grow in knowledge and wisdom.

So if I disagree with something you wrote, don't take it personal. Take it for what it is, an opportunity to engage, and to have a conversation.
