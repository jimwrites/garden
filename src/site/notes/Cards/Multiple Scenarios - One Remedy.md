There are several scenarios we see played out regarding [[Cards/victimhood\|victimhood]]:

First, you really are a victim. You have dealt with real or threatened violence, and it now affects the way you deal with the world around you. This creates some very real obstacles between you and where you want to be.

The second scenario is, there are some barriers, but they aren't so great that they couldn't be overcome with work and persistence. However, you have been told starting at a very early age that your victimhood is real. You are flooded with this message from the people in your group, the media, academia, and even your government. They all tell you that you are stuck, because the system is designed to keep you down.

What if I were to tell you that neither one of those scenarios really matter. What if it doesn't matter whether or not you feel oppressed. What if it doesn't matter whether or not you are an actual victim? I know it feels like it matters, but what if?

The danger, from both of those scenarios is that you find your identity in your victimhood, and you cling to it as a way to draw attention to yourself, and to elevate your status.

But, what if the solution to both of those scenarios is the same: Go out and do the work. Learn. Make yourself more desirable to employers. Take the small victories. And when you get knocked down or tripped up, get back on your feet and get back to work.

It's how generations of people, of all races, have risen from humble, sometimes oppressive beginnings, to achieve success.
