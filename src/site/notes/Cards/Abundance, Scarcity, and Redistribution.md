I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the difference between a scarcity mindset and an abundance mindset.I really see this playing out in the discussions about redistribution policies (ie. Increase the taxes on the rich to pay for free services for lower income).

What I’ve noticed is, how you view the world influences what side you land on with a lot of social issues.

### Scarcity Mindset

A scarcity mindset says that there isn’t enough for everyone, so you have to take from the group that currently has it in order to give it to the groups that are lacking. This mindset is confrontational, and it divides people into groups. It is the “haves” vs. The “have-nots.” This mindset was the basis for Karl Marx writings about the Bourgeoisie (haves) and the Proletariat (have-nots).

Scarcity is also a big driving force in the current culture of identity politics. It pits people and groups against each other competing for scarce resources. Groups look for signs of oppression, real or imagined, in order to justify their claim for what they don’t have, but feel they deserve. It divides people into opposing [teams.](https://www.jimsmoot.com/teams/)

### Abundance Mindset

The other side of that coin is an abundance mindset. This is a mindset that says there are plenty of resources, and that if we are willing to work together there is enough for everyone. The abundance mindset is relational. It says that we are all on the same team, and that if we work together we can take care of each other.

This isn’t socialism, which requires a forced redistribution of resources. This is a voluntary coming together to help each other. This mindset breaks down barriers, and rejects divisions of black and white, gay and straight, Democrat and Republican, rich and poor.

We are all God’s image bearers, and we should treat each other as such, without allowing our differences to separate us.

### Greed and Envy

Listen, I get that we don’t live in an ideal world. There will always be problems with greed. There will always be people that hoard more resources than they need. But even with that, there is still more than enough.

And the greed of a few does not justify envy. It was important enough that it made it as one of the 10 Commandments…Thou shalt not covet.

Just because you feel you are entitled to someone else’s possessions doesn’t mean that you are, in fact, entitled to those possessions.

There is an adage that there is no such thing as a free lunch. In order for you to get something for “free” someone else has to pay for it. That means some entity gets to decide who to take from, and who to give to. I’ve said before, the people who want to make those decisions are typically not the people I want making those decisions.

Let’s stop allowing envy and divisiveness to continue to determine how we treat each other. Let’s instead work on tearing down the barriers that separate us, and work on taking care of each like the brothers and sisters that we are.
