For years now I have been saying that how we talk about problems, and the way we say is matters. That is why this blog exists. I want to work toward getting to the root of problems that are causing so much disunity in our society today. That’s why I believe it’s critical that we get beyond symptoms and look for causes.

I have been reading Thomas Sowell’s book [Discrimination and Disparities](https://amzn.to/38WJgDu), which looks at economic disparities among different groups, many which have nothing to do with discrimination. In this book he makes the comment, “…how people are raised can affect how they turn out as adults.” To which I shouted (in my mind) **“Yes! That’s what I have been saying!”**

### We’re a Product Of Our Upbringing

Every one of us, for good or for bad, is influenced by the environment we grew up in. The words and messages that were put into us shaped the way we look at ourselves and the world around us. For some that upbringing filled them with a sense of self-confidence, while others are filled with self-doubt. Some see the world as a hopeful optimistic place, while others see it as a dark oppressive place.

I see this played out around me in many of the social issues that have seemingly exploded in the past couple of years, and I can’t help but wonder how things would be different if today’s generation would have been filled full of messages of empowerment, and not victimhood.

And by empowerment, I’m talking about the empowerment that comes with learning that you are powerful enough to stand on your own two feet. That with hard work and determination you have the power to change the world around you. What I am not talking about is the “everyone is special, and everyone gets a participation trophy” type of false empowerment.

True empowerment is what gives you the strength to get back up when you’ve been knocked down. It creates a mindset that looks for opportunities, and rejects excuses.

Instead, what we see are people on social media screaming at every real or perceived injustice, no matter how small it may be in reality. There is also a growing sense that every injustice is deliberate, that an insensitive statement must be rooted in hate, and the offender must be destroyed, that every thing that the other side says is a dog-whistle.

### Inequity Does Not Equal Injustice

I write this with complete understanding that for some people the results might not be what they hoped for. Inequities do exist. But at the same time, it is important to understand that every inequity is not because of injustice. There are a lot of things that play into what the outcome may be. And failing to achieve a desired outcome does not mean you are a victim

For me, one of the worst symptoms of this victimhood mentality is that people act as if they are helpless to defend themselves, and more and more turn to the government as the defender. And this ceding of power to an outside group just furthers the sense of being powerless.

I get it, it’s hard to overcome the internal messages we receive in our younger years. We can’t change that input we received when we were growing up. But you are in control of the messages you are feeding into the future generation. If we want to see real change it needs to start with the children of today, and the messages we are filling their heads with.
