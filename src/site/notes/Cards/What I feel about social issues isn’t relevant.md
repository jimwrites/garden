There was a Pride event in our town yesterday. I was asked “How do you feel about that?” It’s not the first time I have been asked. The question typically comes from someone with liberal-leaning beliefs, people that know I am a more conservative leaning Christian. These are folks that already have a pretty good idea of what I believe. When the question came, I couldn’t feeling that I was being baited.

Here is the response that is going to be my go to answer from here on out:

>What I feel about the issue is irrelevant. All that really matters is how I treat people.

There is a whole spectrum of beliefs on any number of issues in society today. Whether it’s LGBTQIA+, immigration, abortion rights, racial/civil rights issues, opinions are widely varied. And for a lot of people, their answer might vary based on circumstances.

For instance, look at people responses regarding abortion. There is no consensus among the pro abortion crowd about when abortion should be restricted. Is it when a heartbeat is detected, or when there is brain-wave activity, or is it anytime before birth?

The same is true of the anti-abortion group. There are those that will say it’s never OK…ever! Then there are those that say morning-after contraceptives are OK, and still others that make exceptions for rape and incest.

The problem is, depending on your chosen [[Cards/teams\|teams]], there are limited acceptable answers. I mean, you can’t possibly be a member of this group/party/team if you still believe (*insert sketchy opinion here*)

Which leads me to the question, why is OK for you to expect me to accept your position, but it’s not OK for me to expect you to accept mine?

And that brings me back around to where I started. I am willing to concede that there are some issues that we will never come to an agreement on. I also understand that in a lot of cases agreement is not necessary.

Because the truth is, I don’t have to agree with your life choices to treat you with grace and kindness. I don’t have to agree with you on everything before I will sit down and talk over a meal or a cup of coffee. I can be friendly with my neighbors without being judgmental about things that don’t affect me at all.

At the end of the day, we’re all sinners, we’re all broken, we all have things that we’re right and wrong about. Your brokenness may look different than mine, but it’s still there.

Despite our flaws, despite our differences, we all need to be better about treating each other with dignity and respect, even if we disagree.
