### The Fog
The 'Fog' is where you don't know where your going and you don't know how to get there.

This stage requires a 30,000 foot view so you can get the lay of the land. You should have at least a sense of direction. From that high up you can look in the direction you need to go and start to define your destination. 
### The Quest
You move from the Fog to Quest (I know where I'm going, but I don't know how to get there).

From 30,000 feet you get an overview, but you are missing all of the details you will need. You might see some indications of where the pathways are, but you can't really see them.

As you zoom in closer you start to see individual paths, obstacles. You can start to work out how you are going to get to your final location.

### Paint by Numbers
The final stage is "Paint by Numbers" (I know where I'm going, I know how to get there). This is where all of the steps are clear, and you just have to follow the steps. The picture has been drawn, you've figured out what colors go where, now all you have to do is match the color to the number, and fill in the spaces.
