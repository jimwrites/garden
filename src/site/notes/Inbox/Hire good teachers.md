A good teacher can save me a considerable amount of time doing my own research, wasting time with trial-and-error, and wandering down rabbit trails that lead to nowhere,

Consider it money well spent.

The problem for me, is finding the right teacher. There are a lot of voices on many different subjects, and a lot of different opinions on which ones are good. I have taken courses in the past that were so basic in their content that they were practically worthless to me.
