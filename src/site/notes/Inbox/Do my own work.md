There can be 2 meanings for this. It could mean, don't take the work of others as my own, or it could be about the value that I get from doing it myself and working through problems.

Is it better to buy a system that someone else has built that is ready to use, or will I get more value out of going through the learning and the thought process to figure it out myself?
