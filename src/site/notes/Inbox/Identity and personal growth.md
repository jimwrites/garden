## Identity and personal growth
#Needs_Attention 
This is an area that really resonates with me. I need to drill down and see where I see this potentially going.

One problem is, this is really general. I will need to make it much more niche. For instance, if I focus in on Identity in Christ it becomes considerably more narrow. I can look to Identity Exchange, and also see who else is broaching this subject.

I don't want the growth part to be just spiritual growth, although that can be part of it. I want it to be more about becoming a better version of yourself (a la Jordon Peterson). I think I have some authority in this area as well, based on my career journey over the past decade.

Personal growth can also tie into how we respond to the world around us. If we want to grow, we need to learn how not to get tossed about by the storms of life.
