:Subtitle: ...and lived to tell about it

When I tell people how I got to my current position, the response is typically either laughter, a look of confusion, or a combination of the two. Because on the surface it doesn’t make a lot of sense. How can I move from a food service supervisor to being in charge of the behavioral health billing department.

# How it started

First a bit of background. I have a degree in Food Service Management, but along the way I also picked up my MBA.

I also have built what Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame) refers to as a talent stack. Over the years I’ve had a few diverse work experiences. Those experiences include restaurant owner, executive director/producer for a community theater, director of a summer camp and retreat center, as well as being in charge of a multi-million dollar contract food service operation.

So when I took the job as food service supervisor, I was working way under my education and experience level. But sometimes, because of the economy, you have to do what you have to do.

The CEO of the organization knew some of my background, and saw my ability to take on challenges, and knew that if he didn’t better utilize what I had to offer I probably wouldn’t stick around for long. He saw a big need in having someone run the billing department, and decided to make me an offer.

You may have noticed in my list of experiences that there was no mention of medical billing. This is a career path for some people, with people spending years gaining the knowledge and experience to run this kind of show, and I was being dropped at the top of that pyramid. When I brought that little tidbit of information up he said, “You’re a smart guy. You’ll figure it out.”

# Drinking from a fire hose

Behavioral health billing is a sub-set of medical billing. While there are many similarities, there are some unique aspects of it. A lot of the services we provide are only covered by state Medicaid plans. The state was also going through a complete redesign of the behavioral health billing system, so all of the old rules were no longer valid.

I felt like a kid that got thrown into the pool and told “you better learn to swim!”

I was overwhelmed. There was so much to learn, and it was all so very foreign to me. But I had to figure it out, and quick. Billing means revenue, and if the billing is screwed up for too long, the company doesn’t stay in business.

Cut to the end of the story — I figured it out.

The real story here is _how I figured it out_. This is just one chapter in a story of how multiple times in my life I took on projects that I didn’t understand, and learned what I needed to know on the fly, and succeeded.

# Start with the big picture

When you start out you may only have a vague sense of where your going, and you certainly don’t know how to get there. It’s like stepping out of your front door and being told to go to another city that you’ve never been to before. You can’t just step out and start walking in the hopes that you’re moving in the right direction.

Your first step is to pull back and get a sense of the big picture.

When I first moved into my position I couldn’t afford to get lost in the details (and there were a lot of details). I didn’t understand the significance of those details, or have any sense of how they fit together. It would make any sense to have someone try to explain how to properly structure an 837(P) file, when I didn’t know what that file was, or what it was used for.

I needed to start by getting an overview, a general understanding of how billing worked. I need to see how information flowed from a provider, to the insurance company, and that turned into deposits in our bank account.

This 30,000 foot view also gives you a chance to see what skills and experiences you already have can come into play. For me, I knew how to lead teams, I had enough computer savvy to not feel totally lost learning a new program, and I had some practice of breaking down large projects into smaller chunks.

# Peel back the layers

Once I had a general understanding of where I was going, and the direction I needed to move, I could start to dig in a little deeper. I could start to peel back that layers and to look at the sub-categories.

In any complex system it’s isn’t just a massive collection of random details. Most of those details fall into unique groups. Before you can really understand the details, you need to have some understanding of the groups.

Some of those groups are going to be more urgent to understand than others, but it’s important to make sure you at least know what the different groups are, and how they work together. By moving through this step too quickly or focusing only on the urgent you run the risk of not fully understanding how everything meshes together.

# Drill down to the details

The next step is getting into the details. Now that I understood the purpose of the different file types, I could start to focus on the details of what information needed to go into the files (and what information to leave out).

This is true of any project you’re taking on. You can write perfect lines of code, but if you don’t use those line correctly, or put them in the wrong order, and you won’t get the results you wanted.

It’s also important to know that this isn’t a completely linear process. it’s not as simple as:

> — Task 1 — Big picture  
> — Task 2 — Sub-categories  
> — Task 3 — Details

You will start seeing the sub-categories while still trying to fully grasp the big picture. And throughout the process details are going to be coming up that you need to get familiar with. That’s OK, it’s a natural progression.

The important thing is that you take the time to understand one step before you become fully immersed in the next step.

_Remember: You can’t eat the elephant in one bite._

It’s a never ending process. I am still making sure I take the time to step back from what I’m working on to make sure it fits into the big picture the way it’s supposed to.

Taking on a new project that you’re unfamiliar with can be a daunting task. But mastering it is a process that can be learned. But once you learn how to do it, you can rinse and repeat throughout your career.
