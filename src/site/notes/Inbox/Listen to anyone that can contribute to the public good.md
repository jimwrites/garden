I need to be willing to listen to the opinion of others, even if I disagree with them, if they are willing to enter into a discussion honestly. There might be some nugget of truth, or a point that I hadn't considered, but I won't here that nugget if I shut down the conversation. That's a very real probablity if I take a "win at all cost" attitude.
