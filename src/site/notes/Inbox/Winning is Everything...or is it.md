For some, winning is everything.

Whether for the team, or for themselves, it's win at all costs. In fact, they become so focused on winning that they've completely lost sight of whether they are truly right or wrong. They assume they're right, because their team told them they were right.

In order to grow, we need to challenge our own beliefs. But that's hard work. It requires self-reflection. It requires being open to the possibility that you might be wrong.

We've gotten so good at building systems that support what we want to believe that we automatically put up defenses against anything that challenges that system. Whether it's who we follow on Twitter, or what news sources we turn to, or what podcast we listen to, we tend to surround ourselves with voices that sound an awful lot like our own.

But if I really want to be better, I need to be willing to admit that even if I disagree with someone, there might be some truth in what they're saying.

Part of the problem is, we have gotten so lot in our team identity, that we no long know who we are as individuals.

And until we can figure out who we are as individuals, we will always be lost in the team identity.
